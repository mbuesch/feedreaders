# feedreader

Feedreader/rs is a Rust re-implementation of the original [feedreader](https://github.com/mlochen/feedreader) Python implementation.

The database format is almost fully compatible with the original.
Re-using an existing database is possible.
We don't implement 'enclosures', though.
Existing enclosures in the database won't be displayed and won't be refreshed.

# Thanks

Thanks to [Marco Lochen](https://github.com/mlochen) for the idea and for the original Python implementation.
